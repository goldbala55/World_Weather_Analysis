Travel Site Weather Analysis Project 
## Project Overview
The project goal is to:
    1. Generate a map with suggested vacation sites based on the client's provided temperature range.
       1. Display the global map with drop pins on each suggested site
       2. Each pin has a 'pop-up' displaying hotel, city, country, and current weather conditions
    2. Generate an itinerary and route map connecting the cities in a loop.
    3. Display just the itinerary stops on a map with pop-ups displaying hotel, city, country, and current weather conditions
